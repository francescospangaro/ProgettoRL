test benches named as tb_x are the professor's made ones, no I don't know, and frankly don't care, what they do
they work, the more difficult ones work, I'm good

test bench 1 -> a random test, just to differ from the one given in class
test bench 2 -> uses multiple resets and 10 different iterations
test bench 3 -> uses a full address of all ones
test bench 4 -> uses multiple resents and 100 different iterations
test bench 5 -> uses multiple resents and 1000 different iterations
